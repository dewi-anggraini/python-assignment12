# Task 6: Reflection
Reflection on Visualization and Dashboards:
1. Static visualizations are pictures of data that don't change.
they are good for presentation or reports because they give a clear overview.
Interactive visualizations, on the other hand, let users zoom, click, or filter the data, this makes it easier to
explore and get what they want to see.

Dashboards are helpful because they bring many charts and views together in one place. 
They make it easy to see updates right away, compare information, 
and make decisions without having to create more graph each time.

Interactive tools like Plotly and Dash make data communication stronger in professional setting.
They allow people to interact with the data directly, which help teams understand the data better, stay engaged,
and make smarter choices based on the data present.
